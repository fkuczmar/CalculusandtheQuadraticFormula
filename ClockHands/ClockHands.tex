\section*{Introduction}
We're all familiar with the problem about finding the rate at which the distance between the tips of the minute and hour hands of a clock is changing at a certain time. But a more interesting question, for both Math 151 and 163, is to ask when this distance is increasing at the fastest rate. 


\begin{exploration}
Experiment with the animation below, perhaps changing the lengths of the hands. Any conjectures?

\section*{A Computational Solution}
%It simplifies things if we ignore time and work in the reference frame of one of the hands

We'll let $a$ and $b$ denote the respective lengths of the hour and minute hands, $\theta$ the angle (in radians) between the hands, and $c$ the distance between their tips. Ignoring time for the moment, our first step is to maximize the derivative,
\[
        \frac{dc}{d\theta} = \frac{ab\sin \theta}{c} = \frac{ab \sin \theta}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2-2ab\cos\theta}}.
\]
So we differentiate again and do some algebra to get
\[
       \frac{d^2c}{d\theta^2} = \frac{ab}{c^3} \left( c^2\cos\theta + ab\sin^2\theta  \right).
\]
