Here's something so counter-intuitive it seems like it can't possibly be true.

\section{The Hanging Slinky}

Setting aside trying to explain why the lower compressed part of the slinky remains suspended for a while, we can nevertheless determine the suspension time. We need only Newton's second law and Hooke's law for an ideal spring.

A slinky is not an ideal spring. In its relaxed state the coils are touching and it cannot be compressed. More importantly, the slinky is \emph{pretensioned}. So it takes some minimum force to strech the slinky and separate the coils. But we can ignore this complication by recognizing that the weight of the compressed coils at the bottom of a suspended slinky is exactly that minimum force. So it does no harm to ignore this part of the slinky and consider only the part above. This part acts like an ideal spring (albeit one that cannot be compressed in its relaxed state) and obeys Hooke's law.

Our first step is to describe the slinky hanging under its own weight. This amounts to finding the \emph{stretching function}
\[
   H = f(L) \, , \, 0\leq L \leq L_0 
\]
for a slinky with relaxed length $L_0$ meters. The function takes as an input the distance (say in meters) of a point on the relaxed slinky from the bottom end in the absense of a gravitational field and returns as an output the distance (in meters) from the corresponding point on the stretched slinky (suspended in a uniform gravitational field) to the (stretched) slinky's bottom end. 

For this the key is to use Hooke's on the portion of the relaxed spring between heights $L$ and $L+\Delta L$. This segment acts like an idea spring with spring constant
\[
        k_\Delta  =  \left( \frac{L_0}{\Delta L} \right) k,   
\]
where $k$ (in Newtons/meter) is the spring constant for the entire slinky of length $L_0$ meters. Letting $g$ (in $m/\text{sec}^2$) be the uniform gravitational acceleration and $\rho$ (in kg/meter) the linear density of the spring, this segment of the spring gets stretched by the weight $W =g \rho L$ (in Newtons) of the spring below it. So by Hooke's law, the little stretch is
\[
     \Delta H - \Delta L =  \frac{W}{k_\Delta} = \left( \frac{g\rho L}{k L_0} \right) \Delta L .
\]
Summing these little streches gives the height function
\begin{align}
    H &= f(L)   \notag  \\
        &= L +  \frac{g\rho}{k L_0} \int_0^L L^* \, dL^*  \notag \\
         & = L + \frac{g\rho}{2kL_0}L^2 \, , \, 0\leq L \leq L_0 .  \label{Eq:Stretch}
\end{align}

Note the full length of the stretched slinky is
\begin{align*}
   H_0 &= f(L_0)  \\
          &= L_0 + \frac{g\rho L_0}{2k} \\
          &= L_0 +  \frac{W_0}{2k}  .
\end{align*}
So a slinky stretched by its own weight $W_0$ is stretched by the same distance as a massless spring (with the same spring constant) stretched by a weight $W_0/2$ attached to its end.

More generally, we can interpret Equation (\ref{Eq:Stretch}) in a similar way. Let
\[
    \lambda = L/L_0
\]
be the dimensionless parameter that measuring the fractional height of a point on the relaxed slinky. Then 
\begin{align*}
       H  & = L + \frac{g\rho}{2kL_0}L^2 \\
           & =  L +   \left(\frac{g\rho L}{2k} \right) \left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right) \\
           & =  L + \lambda  \left(  \frac{W}{2k} \right) ,
\end{align*} 
where $W=g\rho L$ is the weight of the lower part of the relaxed spring of length $L$ meters.  

I'm confused here. Do I want to write this as
\[
           H = L +\frac{W}{2k/\lambda} 
\]
to point out that the lower $L$ meters of the stretched spring acts exactly as we would expect from (\ref{Eq:Stretch}), like a spring with spring constant $k_L = k/\lambda$?

Or should we also write this as
\begin{align*}
        H  & = L + \frac{g\rho}{2kL_0}L^2 \\
            & =  L + \left( \frac{g\rho L_0}{2k} \right) \left( \frac{L^2}{L_0^2} \right) \\
            & = L + \left( \frac{W_0}{2k} \right) \lambda^2 .
\end{align*}

i think both.

In any event, drag the slider $g$ in Line 5 of the worksheet below from $g=0$ to $g=g_0 = 0.5 \text{m/sec}^2$ to turn on the gravitational field and stretch the slinky.
