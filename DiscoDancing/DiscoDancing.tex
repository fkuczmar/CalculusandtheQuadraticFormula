\section*{Poncelet's Porism}

%A spotlight in a circular dance hall rotates at a constant rate as the light beam sweeps around the wall. Where is the light beam when its speed is increasing at the fastest rate?

%Let $R$ be the radius of the dance hall and $a$ the distance between the spotlight and the room's center. Let $\omega$ be the rotation rate (in rad/sec).

Draw a smaller circle (${\cal C}_2$) inside a larger one (${\cal C}_1$). Then pick a point $P_0$ on ${\cal C}_1$ and construct a polygonal path $P_0 P_1 P_2 \ldots$ of chords $\overline{P_0P_1}$, $\overline{P_0P_1}, \ldots$ tangent to ${\cal C}_2$ counterclockwise around ${\cal C}_1$. Most likely the path never closes.  But if by chance the path closes, then it was not because you made a fortunate choice of $P_0$ but because you were lucky in choosing the initial confuguation of circles. The  path then closes for or any starting point and closes in the same way. The figure below shows a configuration of ${\cal C}_1$ and ${\cal C}_2$ for which the path always forms a pentagram.

This curious fact is the circular version of Poncelet's Porism (a similar statement holds for two ellipses). The only proof I've seen relies on defining a new metric around ${\cal C}_1$, one with the property that all chords tangent to ${\cal C}_2$ subtend equal arclengths of ${\cal C}_1$. 

Defining a new metric is like wrapping a number line around ${\cal C}_1$ as illustrated in the figure below, where the tick marks are spaced at equal intervals, say one unit apart. In this case, each chord subtends a (shorter) arc of $8$ units. Then since ${\cal C}_1$ has circumference $24$ units, every path closes after three segments and forms a triangle circumscribed about ${\cal C}_2$.

We start by finding an expression for the speed. We have
\[
  \rho^2 = R^2 + a^2 + 2ar \cos \theta
\]
and so the light's speed is
\[
   v_P = \rho \sec \alpha ,
\] 
where $\alpha = \angle OPA$ is the angle between the radius $OP$ and segment $AP$ (compare with polar coordinates). To express $\alpha$ in terms of

\begin{exploration}

Given $\lambda$, $0 < \lambda < 1/2$, find the center and radius of the envelope of the family of $\lambda$-chords. 

\pskip

Let $(0,a)$ be the circle's center and $r$ its radius.

Let $\phi$ be the angle the first iscochronous chord (with one endpoint $(0,-R)$) makes with the vertical. Then
\[
      \phi = \pi/2 - \text{am}(\lambda T) ,
\]
where
\[
  T = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{du}{\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2 u}}
\] 
is the period of revolution.

Then because the first chord is tangent to the envelope,
\[
     r = (R+a) \sin \phi
\]
And because the envelope belongs to the hyperbolic family generated by the motion,
\[
  \frac{4Ra}{(R+a)^2 - r^2} = k^2 .
\]

Substituting and some algebra leads to a quadratic equation in $a$ with roots
\[
  a =   R \sec \phi \left( \frac{2}{k^2} \sec \phi - \cos\phi \pm   \frac{2}{u} \sqrt{\frac{\sec^2\phi}{k^2} - 1}   \right) .
\]

We choose the minus sign because the plus sign gives the center of the circle in the upper half of the hyperbolic family (the circle that lies outside the pendulum circle.)

But we should not ignore the other root. It gives the $y$-coordinate of the center of the circle in the other half of the hyperbolic family for an opposite motion with pendulum points starting at $(0,-R)$ and $(R\sin(2\phi),R\cos(2\phi))$. See the demo below.

\section*{Jacobi Closure Formulas}

The polygonal path closes when the time subtended by the chords is a rational multiple $\lambda$ of the period. The gives the euqation
\[
     \int_0^{\arccos(\frac{r}{R+a})} \frac{du}{(R+a)^2 - r^2 - 4a\sin^2(u/2)} = \lambda \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{du}{(R+a)^2 - r^2 - 4a\sin^2(u/2)} .
\]
Taking $R=1$ gives a relation between $a$ and $r$. We can use desmos to graph these curves as below. But it's hard to see how to use this to get a relation, even when $\lambda=1/3$ (triangle) or $\lambda  = 1/4$ (quadrilateral).

\section*{Revolving Pendulums}

We know the speed
\begin{align*}
    v_P &= \sqrt{v_0^2-4Rg \sin^2 (\theta/2)}  \\
           &=v_0 \sqrt{1-\frac{4Rg}{v_0^2} \sin^2 (\theta/2)} .
\end{align*}

Want to show that 
\[
    v_P = \frac{v_0}{R+a} \cdot \rho ,
\]
ie. that the speed is proportional to the distance $\rho = AP$ from $P$ to the focus. The constant of proportionality
\[
           \omega_0 = \frac{v_0}{R+a}
\]
is the rotation rate of chord $AP$ when it (the chord) is vertical.

Write the above product as
\begin{align*}
   \frac{v_0}{R+a} \cdot \rho  &= \frac{v_0}{R+a} \sqrt{R^2 + a^2 + 2aR \cos\theta} \\
                                         &= v_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{4aR}{(R+a)^2} \sin^2 (\theta/2)} .
\end{align*}

This is all we need because remember that the focal distance $a$ was defined by the equality
\[
   \frac{4aR}{(R+a)^2} = \frac{4Rg}{v_0^2} .
\]

And since the speed of $P$ is also
\[
  v_P = \omega_P (\rho \sec\alpha)  = \omega_0 \rho , 
\]
where $\omega_P$ is the rotation rate of the chord and $\alpha$ is the angle between the radius $OP$ and segment $AP$, this tells us that
\begin{align*}
\omega_P &= \omega_0  \cos  \alpha  \\
                &= \omega_0 (R\cos \alpha) / R \\
                & = \left( \frac{\omega_0}{R} \right) \rho^\prime ,
\end{align*}
where $\rho^\prime$ is the length of chord $PP^\prime$. So the rotation rate of chord $PP^\prime$ is proportional to its length. The pendulum speed $v_P$ is proportional to $\rho = AP$.


\section{Coaxal Families}
One of my favorite precalculus problems is to find an equation of the line through the intersection points of two circles.


\section{Oscillating Pendulums}
This belongs earlier, but the focal points of the hypberbolic family generated by the pendulum motion with shape $k$ are the roots of the equation
\[
      \frac{4Rg}{(a+R)^2} = \frac{4Rg}{v_0^2} = k^2.
\]
The roots are
\[
      a = R \left(\frac{2}{k^2} -1  \pm \frac{2}{k}\sqrt{\frac{1}{k^2}-1} \right) . 
\]

With launch speed
\[
   v_0 < 2\sqrt{Rg}
\]
from stable equilibrium, the pendulum reaches a maximum angle $\theta_0$ where 
\[
    v_0^2 = 2Rg(1-\cos\theta_0) = 4Rg\sin^2 (\theta_0)/2 .
\]

The pendulum has no focal point (at least not the way we defined it for revolving pendulums) and the quadratic equation that defined the focal length 
\[
     g(a+R)^2 = v_0^2 a = 4Rag\sin^2 (\theta_0/2) .
\]
has complex roots
\[
     a = -R(\cos \theta_0 \pm i \sin \theta_0).
\]

We start by interpreting the expression
\[
       R^2 + a^2 + 2aR\cos\theta.
\]


It is still true, as for revolving pendulums, that
\[
  \rho = 
\]


\section*{Colliding Pendulums}
Instead of tracking the chords between two points moving in the same direction around a pendulum, send the points in opposite directions. The same logic shows that the lines between these points are tangent to a circle ${\cal C}_1$, now  in the outer half of the coaxal family generated by the motion. Let this circle have center $(0,a)$ and radius $r$.

Let one of the two collision points $P$ have displacement angle $\theta$ with coordinates $(R\sin\theta, -R \cos\theta)$. The tangent to the pendulum path at $P$ has equation
\[
       x\sin \theta - y\cos\theta - R = 0.
\]

The center $(0,a)$ and radius $r$ of ${\cal C}_1$ satisfy two conditions:

\pskip

(1) Since ${\cal C}_1$ is in the hyperbolic family generated by the motion with shape $k$,
\[
      4ar = k^2 \left(  (R+a)^2 - r^2   \right)
\]

\pskip

(2) Since the distance from $(0,a)$ to the tangent line at $P$ is $r$, 
\[
     \Big|  -y \cos \theta - R  \Big| = r .
\] 

These two conditions give a quadratic equation in $a$, with one solution $a=0$ (with corresponding radius $r=R$, ie the pendulum path). The other solution, the one of interest, is
\[
     a = \frac{4R}{k^2} \left( 1 - k^2 \sin^2 (\theta/2)    \right) ,
\]
with corresponding radius
\[
  r = R + a\cos \theta .
\]

The motions are illustrated below. For the same reasons as before, the rotation rate of the chord is proportional to its length and the speeds of the two motions are proportional to their respective distances to the points of tangency.
