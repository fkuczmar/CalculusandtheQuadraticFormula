\section*{DiscoDancing}

A spotlight in a circular dance hall rotates at a constant rate as the light beam sweeps around the wall. Where is the light beam when its speed is increasing at the fastest rate?

Let $R$ be the radius of the dance hall and $a$ the distance between the spotlight and the room's center. Let $\omega$ be the rotation rate (in rad/sec).

We start by finding an expression for the speed. We have
\[
  \rho^2 = R^2 + a^2 + 2ar \cos \theta
\]
and so the light's speed is
\[
   v_P = \rho \sec \alpha ,
\] 
where $\alpha = \angle OPA$ is the angle between the radius $OP$ and segment $AP$ (compare with polar coordinates). To express $\alpha$ in terms of

Given $\lambda$, $0 < \lambda < 1/2$, find the center and radius of the envelope of the family of $\lambda$-chords. 

\pskip

Let $(0,a)$ be the circle's center and $r$ its radius.

Let $\phi$ be the angle the first iscochronous chord (with one endpoint $(0,-R)$) makes with the vertical. Then
\[
      \phi = \pi/2 - \text{am}(\lambda T) ,
\]
where
\[
  T = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{du}{\sqrt{1-k^2\sin^2 u}}
\] 
is the period of revolution.

Then because the first chord is tangent to the envelope,
\[
     r = (R+a) \sin \phi
\]
And because the envelope belongs to the hyperbolic family generated by the motion,
\[
  \frac{4Ra}{(R+a)^2 - r^2} = k^2 .
\]

Substituting and some algebra leads to a quadratic equation in $a$ with roots
\[
  a =   R \sec \phi \left( \frac{2}{k^2} \sec \phi - \cos\phi \pm   \frac{2}{u} \sqrt{\frac{\sec^2\phi}{k^2} - 1}   \right) .
\]

We choose the minus sign because the plus sign gives the center of the circle in the upper half of the hyperbolic family (the circle that lies outside the pendulum circle.)

\section{Jacobi Closure Formulas}

The polygonal path closes when the time subtended by the chords is a rational multiple $\lambda$ of the period. The gives the euqation
\[
     \int_0^{\arcsin(\frac{r}{R+a}} \frac{du}{(R+a)^2 - r^2 - 4a\sin^2(u/2)} = \lambda \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{du}{(R+a)^2 - r^2 - 4a\sin^2(u/2)} .
\]
Taking $R=1$ gives a relation between $a$ and $r$. We can use desmos to graph these curves as below. But it's hard to see how to use this to get a relation, even when $\lambda=1/3$ (triangle) or $\lambda  = 1/4$ (quadrilateral).

\section*{Revolving Pendulums}

We know the speed
\begin{align*}
    v_P &= \sqrt{v_0^2-4Rg \sin^2 (\theta/2)}  \\
           &=v_0 \sqrt{1-\frac{4Rg}{v_0^2} \sin^2 (\theta/2)} .
\end{align*}

Want to show that 
\[
    v_P = \frac{v_0}{R+a} \cdot \rho ,
\]
ie. that the speed is proportional to the distance $\rho = AP$ from $P$ to the focus. The constant of proportionality
\[
           \omega_0 = \frac{v_0}{R+a}
\]
is the rotation rate of chord $AP$ when it (the chord) is vertical.

Write the above product as
\begin{align*}
   \frac{v_0}{R+a} \cdot \rho  &= \frac{v_0}{R+a} \sqrt{R^2 + a^2 + 2aR \cos\theta} \\
                                         &= v_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{4aR}{(R+a)^2} \sin^2 (\theta/2)} .
\end{align*}

This is all we need because remember that the focal distance $a$ was defined by the equality
\[
   \frac{4aR}{(R+a)^2} = \frac{4Rg}{v_0^2} .
\]

And since the speed of $P$ is also
\[
  v_P = \omega_P (\rho \sec\alpha)  = \omega_0 \rho , 
\]
where $\omega_P$ is the rotation rate of the chord and $\alpha$ is the angle between the radius $OP$ and segment $AP$, this tells us that
\begin{align*}
\omega_P &= \omega_0  \cos  \alpha  \\
                &= \omega_0 (R\cos \alpha) / R \\
                & = \left( \frac{\omega_0}{R} \right) \rho^\prime ,
\end{align*}
where $\rho^\prime$ is the length of chord $PP^\prime$. So the rotation rate of chord $PP^\prime$ is proportional to its length. The pendulum speed $v_P$ is proportional to $\rho = AP$.


\section{Coaxal Families}
One of my favorite precalculus problems is to find an equation of the line through the intersection points of two circles.


\section{Oscillating Pendulums}
With launch speed
\[
   v_0 < 2\sqrt{Rg}
\]
from stable equilibrium, the pendulum reaches a maximum angle $\theta_0$ where 
\[
    v_0^2 = 2Rg(1-\cos\theta_0) = 4Rg\sin^2 (\theta_0)/2 .
\]

The pendulum has no focal point (at least not the way we defined it for revolving pendulums) and the quadratic equation that defined the focal length 
\[
     g(a+R)^2 = v_0^2 a = 4Rag\sin^2 (\theta_0/2) .
\]
has complex roots
\[
     a = -R(\cos \theta_0 \pm i \sin \theta_0).
\]

We start by interpreting the expression
\[
       R^2 + a^2 + 2aR\cos\theta.
\]


It is still true, as for revolving pendulums, that
\[
  \rho = 
\]
